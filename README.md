# Testing REST APIs with Spring Test and Mockito

This project demonstrates how to test REST APIs effectively using **Spring Test** and **Mockito** frameworks. The tests cover various scenarios, including HTTP request/response validation, mocking service layer dependencies, and verifying API responses. 

Key highlights:
- **Spring Test** is used for integration testing of controllers.
- **Mockito** is employed to mock service-layer dependencies for isolating unit tests.
- The tests include validations for HTTP status codes, JSON responses, and error scenarios.
